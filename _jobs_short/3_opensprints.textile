In 2007 I created an open source version of Gold Sprints (computer driven stationary bicycle racing) for friends. More people started to use it; my software and hardware became the de facto worldwide standard with hundreds of installations worldwide. I, with co-founders, turned it into a business to service higher end or less technical clients who wanted something custom but didn't want to modify the software or assemble the hardware themselves.
