At Kitchensurfing I was the second non-founder on the Product team. I developed features for the product on a daily basis and did technical analysis of planned features. I managed two engineers. I developed Kitchensurfing's first iPhone app. I served as an interim product manager while we hired our first product manager and during that time spearheaded the first prototype of what would become the Same-day dinner product. I was the acting Director of Engineering during an extended absence by my superior and during that time attended board meetings to represent the engineering team's schedules, plans, and interests while also managing a team of 6. I developed our engineering interview process and worked on our hiring plan.
