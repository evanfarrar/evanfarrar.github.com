I joined a handful of engineers working at Groupon very early in their trajectory. I was the first engineer hired after the launch of Groupon and I learned some hard lessons about how to persuade adoption of new technical practices without rocking the boat. At groupon I helped them tame their massive and flaky test suite, optimized SQL, integrated with pre-release facebook features, learned how to deploy to massive constantly changing systems with minimal downtime, did live production debugging and disaster recovery, and launched Groupon's first rewards program.
