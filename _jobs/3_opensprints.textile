In 2007 I created an open source version of Gold Sprints (computer driven stationary bicycle racing) for friends. More people started to use it; my software and hardware became the de facto worldwide standard with hundreds of installations worldwide. A user of the software, Jonathan Morrison, approached Electrical Engineer Luke Orland and I to turn it into a business to service higher end or less technical clients who wanted something custom but didn't want to modify the software or assemble the hardware themselves. We used that revenue to make OpenSprints more consumer friendly and to refine the product further. In 2012 I sold my share of the company to my co-founders to focus on Hopscotch.
