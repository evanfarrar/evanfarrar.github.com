I helped companies learn to deliver software quickly and sustainably, with XP and good engineering practices. Pivotal Labs taught mostly by actions, not just words: pairing with client developers and delivering working software directly to client product owners. I worked on some big products with thousands of requests a minute and some small products that didn't even know what they wanted to be when they grew up.
