At Centro I worked on a small team to develop the company's media management system in Ruby on Rails. Rails was a new framework at the time. Our application provided a UI to explore the thousands of local online advertisers available and their rates to allow Centro's sales team to create national online display advertising plans for clients. Our process was agile using index cards, pairing, TDD and a domain expert as the product owner. I also developed a prototype for a live ad tearsheet generator in Erlang. We moved from SVN to git and were early github users.
